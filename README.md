## 📜 Scripture References

Every ability, dialogue line, and story beat cites its source verse from the Bible. The game is designed to make kids curious about reading the actual Gospel of Mark.

## 🎨 Art Style

All sprites are generated procedurally with SpriteKit — no external assets needed. Characters are 8×12 pixel art rendered at 4× scale. Enemies have horns, wings, and tails; heroes wear robes and sandals.
